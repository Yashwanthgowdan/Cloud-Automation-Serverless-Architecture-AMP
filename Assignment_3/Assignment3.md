Assignment 3: Monitor Unencrypted S3 Buckets Using AWS Lambda and Boto3
‚úÖ Objective
Improve your AWS security posture by creating an AWS Lambda function that automatically detects S3 buckets without server-side encryption (SSE).

üìå Task Overview
Goal: Find S3 buckets that do not have server-side encryption enabled.

What it does:

Lists all buckets in your account.

Checks their encryption configuration.

Logs bucket names that are unencrypted.

‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Instructions
1Ô∏è‚É£ S3 Bucket Setup
Open the S3 Dashboard.

Create multiple S3 buckets:

Make sure some have server-side encryption enabled (AES-256 or aws:kms).

Leave some unencrypted to test detection.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Lambda IAM Role
Open the IAM Dashboard.

Create a new IAM role for Lambda.

Attach the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy.
‚úÖ This is sufficient since you‚Äôre only reading configuration, not modifying buckets.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Lambda Function
Open the AWS Lambda Dashboard.

Click Create Function.

Choose Python 3.x runtime.

Attach the IAM role created in step 2.

Copy and paste the following Python script:

üêç Example Lambda Python Script

import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Get the list of all buckets
    response = s3.list_buckets()
    buckets = response['Buckets']

    unencrypted_buckets = []

    for bucket in buckets:
        bucket_name = bucket['Name']
        try:
            enc = s3.get_bucket_encryption(Bucket=bucket_name)
            rules = enc['ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration']['Rules']
            print(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' is encrypted with rules: {rules}")
        except ClientError as e:
            error_code = e.response['Error']['Code']
            if error_code == 'ServerSideEncryptionConfigurationNotFoundError':
                # This means the bucket does not have server-side encryption enabled
                unencrypted_buckets.append(bucket_name)
            else:
                print(f"Error checking encryption for bucket {bucket_name}: {e}")

    if unencrypted_buckets:
        print(f"Buckets WITHOUT server-side encryption: {unencrypted_buckets}")
    else:
        print("All buckets have server-side encryption enabled.")
‚úÖ How it works
Step	Details
1Ô∏è‚É£	Uses list_buckets to find all buckets.
2Ô∏è‚É£	Calls get_bucket_encryption for each bucket.
3Ô∏è‚É£	If ServerSideEncryptionConfigurationNotFoundError is raised, the bucket is unencrypted.
4Ô∏è‚É£	Prints out the names of all unencrypted buckets.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Invocation
Deploy your Lambda function.

Create a test event (an empty JSON {} works fine).

Click Test.

Check the Lambda logs in CloudWatch.

You‚Äôll see which buckets are unencrypted.
